Even so, from the very childhood Levchenya has started being interested in art through exploration of the home collection of books that has included the history of art and the works of successful artists.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From the age of 17, however, for the sake of family legacy, she has begun to pursue the medical profession working as a junior nurse. In a few years later, Levchenya has&nbsp; moved to Kyiv, where she has entered A. A. Bogomolets National Medical University, and has taken a training route to become a surgeon. Yet, over the years of discovering&nbsp; who she really is, Levchenya has turned back to art and, in 2005, has graduated from the School of Architectural design in Kyiv.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A turning point in Levchenya&rsquo;s artist career has been marked by the acquaintance with a renowned Kyiv city painter and graphic artist Alexandra Prakhova, member of the National Union of Artists of Ukraine. Sasha, as Alexandra Prakhova called herself, represented the dynasty of Prakhov in the fourth generation, has taught Levchenya the art of painting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In 2009, Levchenya has been invited as a guest to the exhibition at Bereznytska &amp;&nbsp; Partners Art Gallery, at that time curated by the Australian artist Adam Nankervis, nomadic museum MuseumMAN, where she has showed her paintings to Adam. The artist has appreciated Levchenya&rsquo;s talent and has included her work to the exhibition&nbsp; Torn World that, later the same year, has been also exhibited in Ukrainian House in&nbsp; Kyiv, Ukraine. Since then, Levchenya&rsquo;s works have been seen around the world in such notable art venues as ArtByGeneva Fair in Geneva; National Cultural-Art&nbsp; Museum Complex Mystetskyi Arsenal, FineArt Gallery, Ukrainian House, Bereznytska&nbsp; &amp; Partners Art Gallery in Kyiv, Ukraine; Art gallery Sady Pobedy in Odesa, Ukraine; Art Southampton, New York; Gagliardi Gallery, London; ARTPALMBEACH-2012, Miami; Fondamenta degli Incurabili, Venice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In 2017, Levchenya was awarded a Special Mention for Excellence at the London Art Biennale. The same year, the artist&rsquo;s personal journey led her to another project that combined scientific approach and artistic thinking. Exhibition named Find your tribe and love them hard at Shcherbenko Art Center (Kyiv, Ukraine) is a manifest&nbsp; of social identity, first proposed by British psychologists Henri Tajfel and John Turner in 1979. The theory discusses a person's sense of belonging to a particular social group. Through the set of photographs, where Levchenya has worn ritual makeup of African, South African and Australian tribes, she has explored people&rsquo;s eagerness to classify&nbsp; themselves as a specific group member and to be equated to a particular nation, occupation and gender.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For a while after, within the conceptual framework of anthropological approach of national cultural patterns, Levchenya has launched OLK MANUFACTORY.
